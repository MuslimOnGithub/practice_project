# prototype_1_gym_app

A new Flutter project.
Intended to be a functional or at least a semi functional app. 
Intended to run on ios or both ios and android.

## Ideaa behind app

Screen #1
Scrollable list of all previously recorded workout by date.

features:
Plus button to add a new workout



Screen #2 
Is what you get when tapping on a given workout to get more details.

features: edit the workout parameters..
- number of sets
- number of excersizes
- workout duration
- workout date


Hopefuly we can add data represention down the line (heat map, grapghs, push notifications)

But first we need a functional app.
